# House Price Prediction
Welcome to this repository! This repository focuses on a house price prediction project, in analyzing and modeling data related to predicting house prices. The project's goal is to deepen our understanding of factors influencing house prices and to build a predictive model facilitating early identification of price trends.

## Repository Contents:
### Dataset: 
- This dataset consists of 1460 rows and 81 columns.
- Independent variables contain house description data.
- The dependent variable refers to SalePrice.

### Features:

### Notebooks:
#### EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) : 
- Check dataset information.
- Check dependent column proportion.
- Check missing values.
- Numerical and categorical column analysis.
- Check the Correlation in some columns to get Insight.
- EDA Insight

#### FE (Feature Engineering):
- Dataset cleaning (drop columns and remove unused values)
- Data encoding
- Handling missing values
- Features scaling

#### Model Preparation
- Train test split

#### Modelling
- Make models
- Models evaluation (Confusional matrix - Test various neighbors - classification report)
- Save the model to pickle

### Model Result:

### Report:
From the results of machine learning modeling, it can be concluded that the best model for predicting heart disease is using the KNN algorithm with a number of neighbors equal to 5.
